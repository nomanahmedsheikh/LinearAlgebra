## Overview
This set of material is intended to understand Linear Algebra from a Computer Science's perspective.
Objective is to read the literature keeping applications of the topic in back of the mind.

Proofs are fundamental for a deeper understanding in Linear Algebra and skipping proofs is injustice.
Therefore, best efforts are made to include proofs wherever deemed necessary.

Hope You Will Enjoy It !!!
  

## Who should read this?
#### **First time taking it**
You should consider grasping each and every line of the material. 

#### **Done 101 course in Linear Algebra at a university**
You can skip the details and proofs. More focus should be on the applications of these topics in Computer Science.
If you do not remember proofs, you should go through them. There is no harm in doing revisions.
