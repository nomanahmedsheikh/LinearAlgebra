## Fourier Series
It says that any periodic function can be written as a linear combination of sines and cosines of different frequencies.
Say _f(x)_ is my periodic function. It can be expanded using fourier series as follows:

<img src="{{site.latex}};f(x)=a_0 + a_1cos(x) + b_1sin(x) + a_2cos(2x) + b_2sin(2x) + ..." title="latex"/>

This can be rewritten as follows
