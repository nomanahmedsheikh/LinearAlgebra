## Vector Space
It is a hypothetical universe (or space) where our vectors lie. 
Not every random space can be called a vector space.
It has to satisfy certain conditions before we can call it a vector space.

A space is called as `Vector Space` if it satisfies these two properties:
1. **Addition**: Sum of two vectors in a vector space should lie in the same vector space.
If **u** and **v** lie in vector space ùïç, then **u** + **v** also lies in ùïç.
2. **Scalar Multiplication**: Multiplication by a real scalar should lie inside the same vector space.
If **u** lies in ùïç, then c**u** also lies in ùïç.

### Examples
1. ‚Ñù<sup>2</sup>: all two dimensional real vectors form a vector space which also known as the x-y plane. 
Consider any set of two dimensional vectors such as `(3,2)`, `(0,0)` or `(œÄ, e)`. 
Sum of these vectors will a two dimensional real vector. Similarly, scalar multiplication of these two vectors gives a vector in ‚Ñù<sup>2</sup>.

2. ‚Ñù<sup>n</sup>: all column vectors with n components

Now, let me give you an example of something that is not a vector space. 
Consider _first quadrant of the x-y plane_. This is not a vector spacy. Why??
- Well, it satifies the addition property
- But it fails for multiplication property. If we multiply any vector in first quadrant with a negative scalar, we would end up in third quadrant.

More formally we can say that the space mentioned in the above example is **closed** with respect to additions but it is not closed with respect to scalar multiplication.

> A space qualifies as a vector space if it is closed with respect to addition as well as scalar multiplication.
