## Vector Space
It is a hypothetical universe (or space) where our vectors lie. 
Not every random space can be called a vector space.
It has to satisfy certain conditions before we can call it a vector space.

A space is called as `Vector Space` if it satisfies these two properties:
1. **Addition**: Sum of two vectors in a vector space should lie in the same vector space.
If **u** and **v** lie in vector space ùïç.
