## Overview

Linear Algebra is at the heart of Computer Science and more specifically Machine Learning. 
It is used over all the places ranging from forward propagation in neural networks to Dimensionality reduction of datasets.
Therefore, it very much make sense to get a deeper understanding of what is going on behind the fancy operations taking place in machine learning.
